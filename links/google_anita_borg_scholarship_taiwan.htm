      <h2>
        Dr. Anita Borg (1949–2003)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Anita Borg believed that technology affects all aspects of our economic, political, social
        and personal lives. A technology rebel with a cause, in her life she fought tirelessly to
        ensure that technology’s impact would be a positive one. It was this vision that inspired
        Anita in 1997 to found the Institute for Women and Technology. Today this organization
        continues on her legacy and bears her name, The Anita Borg Institute for Women and
        Technology (<a href="http://anitaborg.org/">www.anitaborg.org</a>).

      <h3 class="twisty">More about Dr. Anita Borg</h3>
      <div style="display: none; height: 0pt; opacity: 0;">
        <p>
          Her capacity to mix technical expertise and a relentless vision inspired, motivated and
          moved women to embrace technology instead of avoiding or ignoring it. She has touched and
          changed the lives of countless women in the computing fields and beyond. She is
          responsible for including women in the technological revolution – not as bystanders, but
          as active participants and leaders. In 1987, prior to founding the Institute, Anita began
          an email online community called Systers which today has 3,000 members from all over the
          world. In 1994, Anita co-founded the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing
          Conference. The Grace Hopper Celebration has grown to become the largest gathering of
          women in computing in the world. The Anita Borg Institute is the umbrella organization
          for both of these ongoing programs as well as the Virtual Development Center, TechLeaders
          and a host of other dynamic partnerships and collaborations that embrace Anita’s ongoing
          vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          During her life, Anita’s commitment to her vision and expertise in the field gained her
          significant recognition. In 1999 President Clinton appointed her to the Commission on the
          Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology. In 2002, she
          received the Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy, and Employment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born Anita Borg Naffz on January 17th, 1949 in Chicago, Illinois, she grew up in
          Palatine, Illinois, Kaneohe, Hawaii, and Mukilteo, Washington. Anita found her way to a
          computer keyboard in her mid-20s. She received a Ph.D. in computer science from the
          Courant Institute at New York University in 1981. She then embarked on a brilliant
          research career for some of industry’s commercial giants including, Nixdorf,
          Digital/Compaq’s Western Research Lab and Xerox PARC.
